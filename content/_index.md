Hi there! My name is Julian and I am a PhD student at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) in Kaiserslautern (Germany), supervised by [Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/) and [Annette Bieniusa](https://softech.cs.uni-kl.de/homepage/de/staff/AnnetteBieniusa/).
I work on programming languages for distributed systems in order to facilitate the design of safe and secure systems that behave as intended.
Before joining MPI-SWS, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degree from TU Darmstadt where I worked with [Mira Mezini](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/staff_stg/mira_mezini_1.en.jsp) in the [Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/index.en.jsp).

I believe in free software and a decentralized web and I hope that my research contributes to making the development of distributed privacy-friendly applications more accessible.
