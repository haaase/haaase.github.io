Hi there! My name is Julian and I am a PhD student in the [Software Technology Group (STG)](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de) at TU Darmstadt (Germany), supervised by [Mira Mezini](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/staff_stg/mira_mezini_1.en.jsp) and [Annette Bieniusa](https://softech.cs.rptu.de/team/annettebieniusa).
I work on programming languages for distributed systems.
Before joining STG, I spent some time at MPI-SWS working with [Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/) in the Rigorous Software Engineering group.

I believe in free software and a decentralized web and I hope that my research contributes to making the development of distributed privacy-friendly applications more accessible.

You can find a list of my research publications at [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/334/9043.html).
